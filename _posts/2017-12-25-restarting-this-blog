<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have had some lessons on Python, however I would not say that I have fully learnt it yet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have revised some python, and for it be easily used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> I think that I have reached my target, as I have created a simple questionnaire with python, which changes because of the different choices that you make.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Lesson Review</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, I learnt by doing, and this meant that whenever that I was stuck, I would try and try again, until I cracked it. This proved a good strategy as I would not have to ask Mr Keen everytime that I was stuck.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, the main thing that limited my learning was that I was talking to other people about some things that do not help me to improve my work more fully. To add to this, in the times that I was actually working, I did not focus to my full potential.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I would like to focus more, and thus get more work done in the lesson, whilst being more dependent. This will improve my work massively as I will be able to get much more work done in a shorter amount of time, eliminating the need to do masses of work at home.</td>
