**Stanislavski**
 
**Techniques**
 
**The System**
 
This term refers to the methods used by Stanislavski to make a good performance from his actors. It mainly focuses on helping an actor recall any emotions needed for that particular role/scene.

**Given Circumstances**
 
The given circumstances is any relevant information about the character you start off with and the play as a whole. Some information could include; age, situation in play, relationships towards other character and any notes provided. These notes may not tell you everything about the character, but it would be a good starting point.
 
**Emotion Memory**
 
Emotion memory is when an actor draws from his own past and history where they experienced what the character is experiencing. This then helps that actor to be able to be a much better actor as they are feeling exactly what their character is feeling.
 
**Method of Physical Actions**
 
Imagine a simple activity of sitting on a chair. Now imagine a husband sitting on that same chair, except he is now deliberating on whether to get a divorce or not. See how a simple action can be easily changed.
 
**Subtext**
 
The script of a play could also be called a text. The *subtext *is the actual meaning and motivation behind the actions taking place. For example 'Hello' the subtext would then be how to say that line, but this could make the line very different.
 
**Ideas**
 
**The Fourth Wall**
 
One of stanislavski main ideas was that the set that actors performed on would be a solid three dimensional box, called *proscenium theatre*, and this then enhances that fact that there is a fourth wall between the audience and the actors. The actors or performers would try to be as realistic as possible, without addressing the audience or tableau, which would almost immediately lose the effect of realism, or the illusion that real life is being acted out.
 
**Everyday Conversations and Speaking Style** 
 
Stanislavski stated that a realistic play would use prose, or normal speech, rather than poetry, because dos anyone really just speak all in poetry? THe actors would use normal speech, rather than heightened emotional vocabulary.
 
**Ordinary People**
 
In general all of Stanislavski's stories were about normal people, they were not about rich people who had lots of money, rather much more normal people that might actually watch the story. This added the the realism as people could relate to the actors, as if they were on stage and the story or situation was happening to them.
 
**Real Settings**
 
All of his plays were set in realistic places that almost everyone had been too. They won't have a fantasy castle or have a fairy tale, as this would lose the sense of realism. One play was so real that some of the audience truly believed that they were there in the action.
