    <td>This lesson, I learnt by doing. Whenever Mr Keen told us how to do something, I would try it, and if I failed, I would try it again, I have found that this is one of best ways that I learn. THis proved very crucial when I was stuck, I wouldn't have to ask people how to do, I would just try other things, until I got it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, I was limited by my own knowledge, and my ability to recollect things I have learnt last lesson. I need to work on my memory skills, so I can learn more things in a smaller amount of time, thus making me a much better coder.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will like to improve my memory skills, by applying loads of attention to miniscule things that Mr Keen says, so if I am stuck one of those things might be necessary. I would also like to learn much more about spreadsheets in the near future, so I can be a better student.</td>
