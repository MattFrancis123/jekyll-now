(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, I learnt by practicing my code, and whenever I was stuck I would refer back to the codecademy course. This would help me to be more productive as I would not have to be relying to on asking Mr Keen. This was better for both me and him, as he could be helping other people, thus allowing the class to move forward quicker.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, the most important factor that affecting me this lesson, was the fact that I had not practiced my python for a few weeks. I need to be practicing my code more often, which will help me to be quicker with my code, and memory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next, I will be better at coding, as I would have been coding already and the code would be i the forefront of my mind. This would allow me to be more effective as I would not have to be constantly checking the codecademy. Then, I would not have to be checking, meaning that I would be doing much more code, not checking.</td>
