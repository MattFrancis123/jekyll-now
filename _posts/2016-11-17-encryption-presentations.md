    <td>This lesson I learnt by analysing what other people did, and I guess it was quite effective. I learnt what had to go into my presentation to make it as good as some of the better presentations. This will help me in the future when I need to present in another subject. I also learnt by listening, this was quite effective, because I would learn about what people had found out in their own research, and then I would be able to add more to my current knowledge.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, the only habit that really limited my learning was my own listening skills. I known that there wasn't much to put in this section, but any here goes: the only other thing that I was limited by this lesson, was time. Although some of you will think that this is out of my control, I guess it is, but I could have learnt more and paid massive attention to the things that people were saying.</td>

    <td>Next time, I would like to be able to pay more attention to what people are saying. This will help me to improve those ever so important listening skills that I will rely on in later life. </td>
