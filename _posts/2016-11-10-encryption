    <td>Yes, I did reach my target, in the lesson, I learnt a lot about the way that people used encryption and why they do this, and I have carried this on at home whilst making my presentation.</td>

    <td>Well, another project, another set of blog posts. This lesson I learnt by doing, and I have really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the freedom of being able to read in my own time and be able to develop my knowledge of encryption. I also learnt by research in my homework. This was not as effective as being told what to do, but it definitely improves my individuality. However I kept on getting off task, and it took some serious willpower to get back on task. This lesson I persevered and kept going whenever I was stuck and I won't let this get me down.</td>

    <td>I was stuck, like normal then, what’s so special this time. This time I was majorly stuck. I really had no idea on what to, so what did I do? I researched. I used my initiative however this didn’t work all of the time, as when researching if you don’t even know what to research how do you research? It’s simple and this is what I worked out; ask your teacher, no just kidding don’t do that if your teacher is anything like mine, then they will hate that. Instead, we need to replace the teacher with the internet. If you have to research the history of encryption, like I did, then simply search 'encryption history simple’. However only but the ‘simple’ if you, like me, are a student who doesn’t really need to know that Mata Hari’s imprisonment made a miniscule difference on encryption.</td>

    <td>Next time. I would like to do more of my own research by myself, like I have said above and this should help me to become a much better learner and researcher over time. I will have to ask Mr Keen much lesson questions, freeing up his time to help out other students, which mean that our class can move onto much more complicated topics in a shorter amount of time. By researching like I have stated above, I can be much more flexible with my researching. This allows me to spend more time reading the various webpages and less time actually finding them.</td>
