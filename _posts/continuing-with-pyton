    <td>This lesson, I had to learn by doing, since this lesson was a cover lesson and Mr Keen wasn't there. Whenever I was stuck, I would simply try and try again, until I would eventually get it correct. This was very effective as I would be able to be quite an independent learner.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main factor that limited my learning today, was the fact that I would have to be relying only on my previous knowledge, without any help from Mr Keen. This would put a lot of strain on my previous knowledge, and this was not as good as it could ave been, due to the fact that we have been doing Drama for the past term instead of IT. Next time, I need to do more research on the internet first, as I may find the answer there, if not then ask someone for help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I would need to be much more independent, allowing other people to get on with their own work, instead of having to help me. This will help me to improve as I will learn to be much more independent in all of my subjects.</td>
